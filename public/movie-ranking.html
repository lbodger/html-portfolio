<h1>Top Disney Films According to Me!</h1>
<h2>My favourite Disney films</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Aladdin</h3>
<p>The original 1993 version.<br />
This has the absolute best songs, and the wonderful Robin Williams as the Genie. And Rajah... well, he is just gorgeous.</p>
<h3>The Jungle Book</h3>
<p>Again, the original version.<br />
The songs, the animation, the characters. It's just a really lovely take on the Kipling original.</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>I am Moana!!!</p>
<p>Incredible story of a girl refusing to do what is expected of her without looking at other options. Yet she still has the best interests of the people around her at heart.
    <br />Also Maui is probably the hottest animated demi-god ever.
</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>Yeah yeah, I know it's Pixar. But it still counts. Well, I hope it does. I just love the personification of the emotions. I love how they look, how they behave.</p>
